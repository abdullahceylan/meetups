### Venue: Catalyst
### Description:
In this meetup we will talk about Promises and Async / Await. It will be a mix between presentation and workshop. You will get your hands dirty so please bring your laptop.

Will focus on the basics, so it will be helpful for community members who have little or no experience with the subject. But all members are kindly welcomed to come!

A few items from the menu:
- Asynchronous programming with Promises
- Asynchronous programming with Async/Await
- Error handling
- Some good practices on dealing with asynchronous code
