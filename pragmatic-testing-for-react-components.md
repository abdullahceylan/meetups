# End-to-End testing with TestCafe

### Speaker: [Ovidiu Chereche](https://github.com/skidding)
### Date: 22.01.2019
### Venue: Arobs Transilvania Software
### Description:
Let's take a close look at how we test React components and UI components in general. We'll talk about the pros and cons of testing our components and explore how different testing styles affect our development agilityâ€”especially our ability to refactor. Then we'll look at testing techniques specific to React and underscore some philosophical aspects of testing.

Hopefully by the end you'll have new tricks up your sleeve and you'll be excited about testing your React components. I will challenge some "best practices" and I'm looking forward to opposing opinions!
