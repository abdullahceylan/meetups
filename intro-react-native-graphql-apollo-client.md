# Intro to React-Native and GraphQL Apollo-Client

### Speaker: [Emilia Muresan](https://twitter.com/emi_codes)
### Date: 05.02.2019
### Venue: TechNTrade
### Description:

Using Github's GraphQL API as a backend, we'll be working on a small client app in react-native + apollo-client. This app will serve as a playground, and help us cover these topics:
* getting started with react-native: using expo vs. building projects with native code
* handling routing via react-navigation
* setting up apollo-client and executing some basic operations (queries, mutations)
* offline support
* styling using styled-components
* unit tests with jest

This will be a presentation + live coding.
