### Speakers: [Paul Comanici](https://github.com/darkyndy)
### Date: 04.04.2018
### Venue: 8x8
### Description:
 From this talk, you will get a feel on how is to work with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that will help you in building a babel plugin. Presentation will be in Romanian.
Web components are a set of browser standards that allow you to create custom elements that encapsulate templates, styles and logic using just vanilla APIs. But as complexity of the element grows, the APIs might start to feel a bit too low-level and verbose.
 The plan:
Wouldnâ€™t it be awesome if we could use a higher level framework or library to abstract away some of the intricacies of creating web components? Well, one of the solutions is Angular Elements - a way to embed components written in Angular into any application without needing Angular to be present on the page. How is this possible? Simple, the single Angular component is packaged as a native web component providing just the input/output interface and encapsulating the logic.
